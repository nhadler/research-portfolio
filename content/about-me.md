title: "About Me"
---

I'm a [chemistry](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/chem) PhD candidate in the [Hartwig Group](https://hartwig.cchem.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

My research combines transition-metal catalysis with machine learning, data science, and high-throughput experimentation to accelerate discovery in synthetic chemistry. More broadly, I'm interested in leveraging domain knowledge to overcome challenges in applying machine learning to the natural sciences—such as data scarcity and the need for better chemical data representations.

I have a strong background in synthetic chemistry and experience with a range of techniques, including air-free synthesis, high-throughput experimentation, and reaction optimization. I’m also highly experienced in computational chemistry, particularly in the context of transition-metal catalysis, as well as in chemoinformatics, machine learning, software development, and data science—including developing new ML models and building practical tools for chemists.

I earned my BS in [Chemistry](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/chemistry/) from the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Xiaodong Michael Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-fHWhYAAAAAJ&hl=en) on developing new synthetic methods using gold catalysis.

Outside the lab, you can find me hiking, brewing coffee, tending my vegetable garden, or throwing [pottery](https://art.nhadler.com/).
