Below are some of the projects I have developed throughout my research. Most of these (and others) can also be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nhadler).

- **[Landscaper.](https://github.com/Vis4SciML/Landscaper)** A Python framework that constructs, quantifies, and visualizes deep-learning loss landscapes in both low and high dimensions. Equipped with efficient sampling strategies, a novel TDA-based metrics, and interactive plotting utilities, the library offers an end-to-end toolkit for uncovering geometric and topological insights to better understand complex ML models.

- **[MolSelector](https://github.com/nhadler/MolSelector)** is a lightweight web app for triaging molecular structures (.xyz, .mol, .mol2). Point the app at a folder of files, explore each molecule in an interactive 3D viewer powered by 3Dmol.js, and rapidly tag it as accept or decline. Decisions are written to selection_results.csv in the chosen folder so they can be versioned or analyzed later.
