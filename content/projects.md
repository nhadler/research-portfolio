Below are some of the projects I have developed throughout my research. Most of these (and others) can also be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nhadler).

- **[Landscaper.](https://github.com/Vis4SciML/Landscaper)** A Python framework that constructs, quantifies, and visualizes deep-learning loss landscapes in both low and high dimensions. Equipped with efficient sampling strategies, a novel TDA-based metrics, and interactive plotting utilities, the library offers an end-to-end toolkit for uncovering geometric and topological insights to better understand complex ML models.
