Below are some of the projects I have developed throughout my research. Most of these (and others) can also be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nhadler).

- **[Landscaper](https://github.com/Vis4SciML/Landscaper).** A Python framework for constructing, quantifying, and visualizing deep-learning loss landscapes in both low and high dimensions. With efficient sampling strategies, a novel TDA-based metric suite, and interactive visualization tools, Landscaper provides an end-to-end workflow for uncovering geometric and topological structure in modern ML models.

- **[MolSelector](https://github.com/nhadler/MolSelector).** A lightweight web app for triaging molecular structures (.xyz, .mol, .mol2). Point it to a directory of files, inspect each molecule in an interactive 3D viewer powered by 3Dmol.js, and quickly tag it as accepted or rejected. Decisions are logged to a csv file in the same folder for downstream analysis or version control.
