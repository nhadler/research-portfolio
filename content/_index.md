<h1>Nicholas Hadler</h1>

I'm a [chemistry](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/chem) PhD candidate in the [Hartwig Group](https://hartwig.cchem.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

My research focuses on combining transition-metal catalysis with machine learning, data science, and high-throughput experimentation to accelerate discovery in synthetic chemistry. More broadly, I'm interested in how we can leverage domain knowledge to address the challenges of applying machine learning to the natural sciences.

## Selected Projects

- **[Landscaper.](https://github.com/Vis4SciML/Landscaper)** A Python framework that constructs, quantifies, and visualizes deep-learning loss landscapes in both low and high dimensions. Equipped with efficient sampling strategies, a novel TDA-based metrics, and interactive plotting utilities, the library offers an end-to-end toolkit for uncovering geometric and topological insights to better understand complex ML models.

- **[MolSelector](https://github.com/nhadler/MolSelector)** is a lightweight web app for triaging molecular structures (.xyz, .mol, .mol2). Point the app at a folder of files, explore each molecule in an interactive 3D viewer powered by 3Dmol.js, and rapidly tag it as accept or decline. Decisions are written to selection_results.csv in the chosen folder so they can be versioned or analyzed later.
