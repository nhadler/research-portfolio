<h1>Nicholas Hadler</h1>

I'm a [chemistry](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/chem) PhD candidate in the [Hartwig Group](https://hartwig.cchem.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I'm exploring how machine learning can accelerate discovery in synthetic chemistry. 

My research brings together transition-metal catalysis, data science, and high-throughput experimentation to make catalysis faster, more predictive, and more data-driven. I'm especially interested in how domain knowledge can be used to make machine learning more effective for the natural sciences.

## Selected Projects

- **[Landscaper](https://github.com/Vis4SciML/Landscaper).** A Python framework for constructing, quantifying, and visualizing deep-learning loss landscapes in both low and high dimensions. With efficient sampling strategies, a suite of TDA-based metrics, and interactive visualization tools, Landscaper provides an end-to-end workflow for uncovering geometric and topological structure in modern ML models.

- **[MolSelector](https://github.com/nhadler/MolSelector).** A lightweight web app for triaging molecular structures (.xyz, .mol, .mol2). Point it to a directory of files, inspect each molecule in an interactive 3D viewer powered by 3Dmol.js, and quickly tag it as accepted or rejected. Decisions are logged to a CSV file in the same folder for downstream analysis and version control.
